  - The graph associated to a HIT is the graph generated where

      - each point-constructor is a node
      - each path-constructor is an edge

  - Question: change the direction of one edge generated
    a HIT equivalent.

  {% comment %}
  Some marks to accompany the code:

  - üëè looks great!
  - üîç review please!
  - üÜò needs refactor


  My style guide:

  - use `--` to make inference-alike some functions, some lemmas -
  after the signature, I'd like as much as possible a blank line, for mental pause
  - I avoided that if the signature is too short, in which case it should easier
  to understand
  - Levels using the letter ‚Ñì and superindexes i,j,k.
  - A type family over `A`, we use C, or maybe P, I've decided yet.
  - paths should be named as p, q, Œ±, Œ≥, (last two cases, when there are sigmas)
  - include the most common synonym from the book or HoTT-Agda if there are
  more convenient.
  - use Sigma and Pi types as much as it's possible
