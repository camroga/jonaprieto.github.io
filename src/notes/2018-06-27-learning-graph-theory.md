Learning graphs on youtube.

### Graph Theory by [Sarada Herke](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV8tyRakGZuXUwD-wYH1yGg)

- [x] [01. Seven Bridges of Konigsberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIb1cz06UwI)

  * Seven Bridges problem

  ![](/assets/png-images/2018-06-27-learning-graph-theory-c13de192.png)

  * **Eulerian walk/path/trail** in a finite graph is a path which visits *every edge* exactly once

  * **Eulerian circuit/cycle** is an Eulerian path which starts and ends on the same vertex

  * **Degree/Valency**: is the number of edges incident to the vertex, with
  loops counted twice, denoted by $$\deg ‚Å° ( v )$$

    - Odd degree for starting or ending nodes
    - Even degree for intermediate nodes

  * **Lemma**

  If a graph has an **Eulerian walk** then the number of **odd degree vertices** is
  either **0 or 2**. 0 when the path starts where it ends. 2 when there is a
  starting point different from the ending point.

- [x] [02. Definition of a Graph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1Zwhz-MhCs)

  A graph is a pair $$G = (V, E)$$, where $$V$$ is a set of vertices and $$E$$ is a subset
  of the cartesian product $$V \times V$$.

  - **Size** of the graph is denoted by \|E\|
  - **Order** of the graph is denoted by \|V\|

  Some kind of graphs:

  - **Simple graphs** : No loops, no multiple loops
  - **Directed graphs** : each edge has a direction associated to it
  - **Undirected graphs** : edges without any direction

- [x] [03. Examples of Graphs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLOvB1qFE1E)

  $$uv$$ stands for $$\{u, v\} \in E$$, in a graph $$G = (V(G), E(E))$$.

- [x] [04. Families of Graphs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71XbdtoG7P8)

  - [**A Complete graph**](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CompleteGraph.html)
    $$K_n$$ on $$n$$ vertices is a simple (no-loops, no-multiple loops) with an
    edge between every pair of vertices.

    - $$ \# (E) = n \cdot C_2$$, $$C_2$$ is the binomial coefficient

    ![](/assets/png-images/2018-06-27-learning-graph-theory-6b99df17.png)

  - Empty graphs
  - Bipartite graphs and (Complete Bipartite graphs $$K_{n,m}$$)

  - Path $$P_n$$ is graph whose vertices can be arranged in a sequence.

  ![](/assets/png-images/2018-06-27-learning-graph-theory-1ff903e5.png)

  - Cycle $$C_6$$ is a graph whose vertices can be arranged in a cyclic sequence
    such That the ending vertex is connected with the starting vertex forming a
    chain. The cycle $$C_n$$ is just the path $$P_n$$ after adding the edge that
    connects the tail and the head of the path.

  - Triangle = $$C_3$$ and $$K_3$$

- [x] [05. Connected and Regular Graphs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEyuUXQs5ko)

  - [A **connected graph**](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConnectedGraph.html) is a
    graph which is connected in the sense of a topological space, i.e., there is
    a path from any point to any other point in the graph.

    ![](/assets/png-images/2018-06-27-learning-graph-theory-0f87473b.png)

  - A **disconnected graph** is a graph G is said to be disconnected if it is not
    connected, i.e., if there exist two nodes in G such that no path in G has
    those nodes as endpoints.

    ![](/assets/png-images/2018-06-27-learning-graph-theory-cee5a515.png)

  - **(Open) neighbourhood** of v in G is

    {: .equation}
      $$ N_{G}(v) = \{u | uv \in E(G) \}$$

  - **(Closed) neighbourhood** of v in G is

    {: .equation}
      $$ N_{G}[v] = N_{G}(v) \cup \{ v \}$$

  - The **degree of a vertex** $$v \in V(G)$$ in terms of neighbourhoods is

    {: .equation}
      $$ \deg_{G} (v) = \# N_{G}(v) $$

  - A graph is **r-regular** if $$\deg_{G}(v) = r$$ for all $$v \in V(G)$$
  - The **minimum degree** is denoted by $$\delta(G)$$
  - The **minimum degree** is denoted by $$\Delta(G)$$

- [x] [06. Sum of Degrees is ALWAYS Twice the Number of Edges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoRhmz_OSBY)

  - **Theorem**:

    {: .equation}
      $$ \sum_{v \in V(G)} \deg(v) = 2 \# E(G) $$

  - **Corollary**: In any graph the number of odd degree vertices is even.
