New tutorial using Agda to show concepts of logic and programming theory.

The **official repository** and website is the following:

  [https://wenkokke.github.io/sf/](https://wenkokke.github.io/sf/)

However, I maintain **my own fork**:

  [https://jonaprieto.github.io/sf](https://jonaprieto.github.io/sf)

Anyway, thanks to the authors (Wen Kokke and Philip Wadler) for this new
resource to continue learning more about this interesting field.
