I'm a Ph.D. student at [University of
Bergen](https://www.uib.no/en/ii) under the advisory of [Marc
Bezem](https://cas.oslo.no/fellows/marc-bezem-article2086-828.html) and
co-supervised by [Håkon Robbestad](http://staff.math.su.se/gylterud/).
We are working on type theory and some connections with other branches
of mathematics.

Before this, I lived two years in [Medellín,
Colombia](https://www.google.no/search?q=medellin+colombia&newwindow=1&safe=active&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjb6-m_5MzdAhXLl4sKHcolC0AQ_AUIDigB&biw=1152&bih=638)
where I did my Master under the
[advisory](http://www1.eafit.edu.co/asr/supervised-students.html) of [Andrés
Sicard-Ramírez](http://www1.eafit.edu.co/asr/) in the group of the [Logic and
Computation](http://scienti.colciencias.gov.co:8080/gruplac/jsp/visualiza/visualizagr.jsp?nro=00000000008091)
research group in the Mathematical Sciences Department at [Universidad
EAFIT](http://www.eafit.edu.co/). And previously, I've got my bachelor in
mathematics from [Universidad Sergio
Arboleda](https://www.usergioarboleda.edu.co) and I also studied at UNAL.

### About this blog

The sources of this blog are open source. The blog is using the following projects:

- `github-pages`
- `jekyll` with my modified version of the minima theme
- `algolia` the search engine plus modifications
- `agda` to type-check some experiments
- `agda2html` for embedding `Agda` code in HTML
- `ipe` to draw nice pictures
-  Since April 2018 I changed to [https://tex.s2cms.com/](https://tex.s2cms.com/) to render `Latex` instead of `KaTeX`
- `timelinejs` to show some test timelines
- `linkify` to replace any url address to anchor tags
- `yarn` for javascript dependencies
- `gulp+browserSync` for development
