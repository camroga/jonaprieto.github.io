We study dynamic programming through examples. My goal here is to keep a list of
the recursion formulation for each problem as a help to solve the problem and
similars. I'm not interested *really* neither in the implementation nor a very
long description, just an recursion function that solves the problem and gives
enough sights. The complexity for each solution is left to the reader.

## 0–1 Knapsack

<div class="exercise" markdown="1">
**Problem:**<br/>
Maximize the sum of the values of the items in the knapsack so that the sum of
the weights is less than or equal to the knapsack's capacity.
</div>

**Explicit Formulation:**

Given
  - a set of $$n$$ items numbered from $1$ up to $n$,
  - each item has a weight $$w_i$$ and a value $$v_i$$,
  - the bag has a maximum weight capacity $W$.

{: .equation }
  $$\begin{align*}
    \maximize &\sum_{i=1}^n v_i x_i \\
    \st.      &\sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i \leq W\\
              &x_i \in \{0,1\}.
    \end{align*}
  $$

Here $x_i$ represents the number of instances of item $i$ to include in the knapsack.

<div class="proof" markdown="1">
**Recursion:**

Define $f(i,w)$ to be the maximum value that can be attained with **weight less
than or equal** to $w$ using items up to $i$ (first $i$ items).

We can define $f(i,w)$ recursively as follows:

{: .equation }
  $$\begin{align*}
  f(i, w) =
  \begin{cases}
  0                                         &\text{if }i = 0,\\
  f(i-1,\,w)                                &\text{if }w_i > w,\\
  \max\{f(i-1,\,w),\,f(i-1,w-w_i)+v_i \}   &\text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
  \end{align*}$$

The solution can then be found by calling $f(n,W)$.
</div>

Variations:

  - *bounded knapsack problem (BKP)*:  $0\leq x_{i}\leq c$
  - *unbounded knapsack problem (UKP)*: $x_{i}\geq 0$

## 3-partition

<div class="exercise" markdown="1">
**Problem:**<br/>
Given integers $a_1, \cdots a_n$, we want to determine
whether it is possible to partition of $\{1,\cdots, n\}$ into three disjoint subsets
$I$ , $J$, $K$ such that

{: .equation }
  $$\begin{equation*}
  \sum_{i\in I} a_i = \sum_{j\in J} a_j = \sum_{k\in K} a_k = \frac{1}{3}\sum_{i=1}^n a_i.
  \end{equation*}
  $$
</div>

<div class="proof" markdown="1">
**Recursion:**<br/>
- Assume that $$ S = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i$$ is divisible by $3$, otherwise we can't make such a partition.


For this decision problem, we define $f(i, p, q)$ to be $\true$ if we are able to find
two disjoint sets $I$ and $J$ such that each sum $p$ and $q$ respectively
with the first $i$ items available.

<div class="equation">
  $$\begin{align*}
  \sum_{i\in I} a_i &= p,\\
  \sum_{j\in J} a_j &= q,\\
  I \sqcup J &= \{1, \cdots, m\}.
  \end{align*}$$
</div>

The recursive formulation of the solution is as follows:

{: .equation }
  $$\begin{align*}
  f(i, p, q) =
  \begin{cases}
  \false                                     &\text{if }i = 0,\\
  \true                                      &\text{if }i = 1 \and p = q = 0,\\
  \true                                      &\text{if }i = 1 \and a_i = p,\\
  \true                                      &\text{if }i = 1 \and a_i = q,\\
  \false                                     &\text{if }i = 1,\\
  \true                                      &\text{if }f(i-1, p , q),\\
  \underbrace{f(i-1,p - a_i, q)}_{i\in I \and i\not\in J}
  \or \underbrace{f(i-1,p, q-a_i)}_{i\not\in I \and i\in J} \}   &\text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
  \end{align*}$$

The answer then can be found by computing $f(n, \frac{S}{3}, \frac{S}{3})$.
The sets $I$ and $J$ can be found by using an auxiliary array to register if which
set we put each element.
</div>

## Sequence alignment

<div class="exercise" markdown="1">
Find the highest cost for an *alignment* of two
strings $x$ and $y$ based on a scoring matrix $\delta$ of $(N+1\times N+1)$ where
$N$ is the size of the alphabet with an extra character `-` for gaps.

An alignment is a way of matching up the two strings. It also needs to follow
the rules:

 - The characters of each string must appear in order in the align
 - Each column of the alignment must contain a character from at least one of the strings
</div>

<div class="proof" markdown="1">
**Recursion:**

Define $f(i,j)$ to be the maximum score for an alignment
that can be obtained when we attempt to align the strings $x$, $y$
in one of three possible ways in the following. The gaps are represented by `-`.

$$\begin{align*}
x_i&\cdot \cdots x_{n}\\
y_j&\cdot \cdots. \\[3mm]
x_i&\cdot \cdots \cdot \cdot \cdots x_{n}\\
-&\cdot \cdots \cdot y_j\cdot \cdots. \\[3mm]
-&\cdot \cdots \cdot x_i\cdot \cdots \cdot x_{n}\\
y_j&\cdot \cdots \cdot \cdots.\\
\end{align*}$$

We can define $f(i,j)$ recursively as follows, moving us from left to right
with the strings to respect their order. The first argument $i$ is about the position in the string $x$,
and the argument $j$ is about the position in the string $y$ in the following definition.

{: .equation }
  $$\begin{align*}
  f(i, j) =
  \begin{cases}
  0  &\text{ if } i > n \and j > m, \\
  \max \begin{cases}
  \delta(x_i,y_i) + f(i+1,j+1)  &\text{if } i \leq n \and j \leq m,\\
  \delta(x_{i},-) + f(i+1, j)   &\text{if } i \leq n, \\
  \delta(-,y_{j}) + f(i, j+1)   &\text{if } j \leq m
  \end{cases}
   &\text{ otherwise.}       
  \end{cases}
  \end{align*}$$

The solution can then be found by calling $f(1,1)$.

## Edit distance

<div class="exercise" markdown="1">
**Problem:**<br/> Given two strings $x$ and
$y$ on an alphabet Σ, the *edit distance* or also called *levenshtein distance*
between $x$ and $y$ is the minimum-weight series of edit operations that
transforms $x$ into $y$. The operations available are *insertion*, *deletion*,
and *substitution*. The cost for all these operations is given by the functions
$w_\mathrm{ins}$,$w_\mathrm{del}$ and $w_\mathrm{subs}$ respectively.
</div>

<div class="proof" markdown="1">
**Recursion:**<br/>
The edit distance between of $x = x_1\ldots x_n$ and $y = y_1\ldots
y_m$ is given by the recurrence $f(n,m)$ defined as follows.

{:. equation }
  $$\begin{align*}
  f(i,j) = \begin{cases}
  \sum_{k=1}^{i} w_\mathrm{del}(x_{k})  &\text{ if } 1 \leq i \leq m \and j = 0,\\
  \sum_{k=1}^{j} w_\mathrm{ins}(y_{k})  &\text{ if } 1 \leq j \leq m \and i = 0,\\
  \min \begin{cases}
  f(i-1, j-1)                                  &\text{ if } x_i = x_j,\\
  f(i-1, j-1) + w_\mathrm{subs}(a_{i}, b_j)  &\text{ fix } x_i,\\
  f(i-1, j) + w_\mathrm{del}(a_{i})     &\text{ delete }x_i, \\              
  f(i, j-1) + w_\mathrm{ins}(b_{j})     &\text{ insert }y_j. \\              
  \end{cases} & \text{ otherwise .}
  \end{cases}
  \end{align*}
  $$

The edit distance is found by calling $f(n,m)$ for the given strings $x$ and $y$.
