We study dynamic programming through examples.
My goal here is to keep a list of recursion formulation
of some common problems.

## 0–1 Knapsack problem

<div class="exercise" markdown="1">
Maximize the sum of the values of the items in the knapsack so that the sum of
the weights is less than or equal to the knapsack's capacity.

Given:
  - a set of $$n$$ items numbered from $1$ up to $n$,
  - each item has a weight $$w_i$$ and a value $$v_i$$,
  - the bag has a maximum weight capacity $W$.

Solve:

{: .equation }
  $$\begin{align*}
    \maximize &\sum_{i=1}^n v_i x_i \\
    \st.      &\sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i \leq W\\
              &x_i \in \{0,1\}.
    \end{align*}
  $$

Here $x_i$ represents the number of instances of item $i$ to include in the knapsack.
</div>

<div class="proof" markdown="1">
**Formulation.**

Define $f(i,w)$ to be the maximum value that can be attained with **weight less
than or equal** to $w$ using items up to $i$ (first $i$ items).

We can define $f(i,w)$ recursively as follows:

{: .equation }
  $$\begin{align*}
  f(i, w) =
  \begin{cases}
  0                                         &\text{if }i = 0,\\
  f(i-1,\,w)                                &\text{if }w_i > w,\\
  \max\{f(i-1,\,w),\,f(i-1,w-w_i)+v_i \}   &\text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
  \end{align*}$$

The solution can then be found by calling $f(n,W)$.
</div>

Variations:

  - *bounded knapsack problem (BKP)*:  $0\leq x_{i}\leq c$
  - *unbounded knapsack problem (UKP)*: $x_{i}\geq 0$
