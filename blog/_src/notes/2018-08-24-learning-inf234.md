- Big-Oh rules
- Omega, and small big-oh.
- Divide and Conquer
  - Sorting problem. Runtime analysis.
  - T(n) = a T(n/b) + O(n^a) where a is the branching factor, b is the size of the problems.
  - Geometric series: 1 + r + r^2 + ... + r^t = (1 - r^(t+1))/(1 - r)
    - if r < 1, the sums tends to be 1 / (1 - r).
  - MergeSort algorithm

- Master Theorem (and proof) (some logarithms rules viewed)

## 2018-09-03

- Review the formulation of the master algorithm
- Divide & conquer algorithm to find the median of an array of integers.

- [x] Exercise 2.5. Master Theorem
- [x] Exercise 2.12. Recurrence substitution.
- [x] Exercise 2.14. Just use Mergesort and remove naively the duplicates
- [x] Exercise 2.13. Catalan Numbers (Nice one).

If $$B_{n+2}$$ is the number of full binary trees with exactly n vertices,
then, we can compute recursively the solution by following that's equal to

{: .eq }
  $$B_{n+2} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} B_{k} B_{n+1-k} $$

where, $$B_{k} = 0$$ when k is odd and $$B_1 = 1$$.

  - Class was Introduction to Graphs, DFS, explore method, pre and post numbers

  - [x] Exercise 2.20.
    - Algorithm: counting sort.
    - Why not \Omega(nlog n)? because is not based on comparisons.

  - [ ] Exercise 2.23.
    - a) Algorithm Majority
```
def Majority(A):
  if len(A) == 1:
     return A[0]
  half1 =  Majority(first half)
  half2 =  Majority(second half)
  check half1 in all the array to be the majority element
  if it's not check with half2 in all the array
  else: there is no majority element
```

  - DFS, DFS tree, DFS forest construction in O(n + m) where n is #vertices and m is #edges
    - 👨‍🎓 When drawing always make the arrows (dotted) to point out the exploration traces.
    - tree edges are the first edges in the DFS from parent to child, if the child
    is already discovered then a edge parent-child becomes a forward edge.
  - Connected Component in O(n+m):
    - Run a DFS for all vertices, if a vertex is unvisited the there is a component
    with that vertex, and continue with next vertex.
  - **Check the type of edges**:

  Review the pre/post numbers for each vertex in the exploration of the graph:
For instance: `pre(u) < pre(v) < post(v) < post(u)`:

And then we have:

  - DAG (Directed acyclic graphs) ( a cycle has not repeated points)

  - [Tarjan' Strongly connected component algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm)
  - [Kosaraju' Strongly connected component algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosaraju%27s_algorithm)
    - meta graph (DFS too)

```
  Kosaraju's Algorithm:

  1. For each vertex u of the graph, mark u as unvisited. Let L be empty.
  2. For each vertex u of the graph do Visit(u), where Visit(u) is the recursive subroutine:
      If u is unvisited then:
        - Mark u as visited.
        - For each out-neighbour v of u, do Visit(v).
        - Prepend u to L.
      Otherwise do nothing.
  3. For each element u of L in order, do Assign(u,u) where Assign(u,root) is the recursive subroutine:
     If u has not been assigned to a component then:
      - Assign u as belonging to the component whose root is root.
      - For each in-neighbour v of u, do Assign(v,root).
    Otherwise do nothing.
```
