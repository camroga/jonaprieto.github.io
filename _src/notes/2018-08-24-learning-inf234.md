- Big-Oh rules
- Omega, and small big-oh.
- Divide and Conquer
  - Sorting problem. Runtime analysis.
  - T(n) = a T(n/b) + O(n^a) where a is the branching factor, b is the size of the problems.
  - Geometric series: 1 + r + r^2 + ... + r^t = (1 - r^(t+1))/(1 - r)
    - if r < 1, the sums tends to be 1 / (1 - r).
  - MergeSort algorithm

- Master Theorem (and proof) (some logarithms rules viewed)

## 2018-09-03

- Review the formulation of the master algorithm
- Divide & conquer algorithm to find the median of an array of integers.
- Selection pivot algorithm to improve the median selection algorithm.
  - https://brilliant.org/wiki/median-finding-algorithm/

- [x] Exercise 2.5. Master Theorem
- [x] Exercise 2.12. Recurrence substitution.
- [x] Exercise 2.14. Just use Mergesort and remove naively the duplicates
- [x] Exercise 2.13. Catalan Numbers (Nice one).

If $$B_{n+2}$$ is the number of full binary trees with exactly n vertices,
then, we can compute recursively the solution by following that's equal to

{: .eq }
  $$B_{n+2} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} B_{k} B_{n+1-k} $$

where, $$B_{k} = 0$$ when k is odd and $$B_1 = 1$$.

  - Class was Introduction to Graphs, DFS, explore method, pre and post numbers

  - [x] Exercise 2.20.
    - Algorithm: counting sort.
    - Why not \Omega(nlog n)? because is not based on comparisons.

  - [ ] Exercise 2.23.

    - Sources (A,B) and the sinks (G, H)
    - How many toposorts the graph has? 6.

  - DFS, DFS tree, DFS forest construction in O(n + m) where n is #vertices and m is #edges
    - 👨‍🎓 When drawing always make the arrows (dotted) to point out the exploration traces.
  - Connected Component in O(n+m):
    - Run a DFS for all vertices, if a vertex is unvisited the there is a component
    with that vertex, and continue with next vertex.
  - **Check the type of edges**:

  Review the pre/post numbers for each vertex in the exploration of the graph:
For instance: `pre(u) < pre(v) < post(v) < post(u)`:

And then we have:

  - DAG (Directed acyclic graphs) ( a cycle has not repeated points)
