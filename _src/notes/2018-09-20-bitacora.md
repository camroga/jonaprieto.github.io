This is my bitacora.
Some conventions used here:

- 📆 : todo
- 🚶 :‍ reading
- ✍️ : writing
- ❓ : question, no idea
- 🏁 : goal

### Goals

The goals can change along the time doing this research but
at least we have some candidates or current topics:


**HoTT**
  - [pathovers](http://tinyurl.com/pathorvers): almost finished ✍️
  - [circle equivalences](http://tinyurl.com/pathorvers): with one postulate  ✍️
  - [mini-hott](http://tinyurl.com/mini-hott): a mini hott library for Agda ✍️
  - ❓ The graph associated to a HIT is the graph generated where
      - each point-constructor is a node
      - each path-constructor is an edge

    change the direction of one edge generates a HIT equivalent?

**Graphs**
  - 🚶 Find a *good* predicate for planar graphs

  {:.equation }
    $$ \sum_{g:\mathsf{Graph}}~\mathsf{isPlanar(g)}$$

--------

### Meetings

Showing the most recent to the oldest.

#### **2018-09-14**

With Håkon:

- HoTT stuff: we review the lemmas for the flattening lemma. We went
through Lemma 6.12.1 to Lemma 6.12.7.
- Graphs: I commented a little bit the MacLane's cycle-space and
Tutte's theorem which relies on the idea of contractible version of the graphs
to use later the Kuratowski theorem.

With Marc:
- Working on [the circle article](http://tinyurl.com/circle-hott) to remove the postulated lemmas


#### **2018-09-07**

With Håkon:
- We sketch briefly **alga** or *the algebra of graphs* described in (\cite{Mokhov2017}).
- We review the inductive definition for graphs in {% cite Tammet1996 %},
we wanted to have a predicate like $$ \sum_{g:\mathsf{Graph}}~\mathsf{isPlanar(g)}$$
- Håkon also pointed out MacLane's planar graph characterization to
review in future sessions.

With Marc:
- Making some improvements to [Pathovers' article](http://tinyurl.com/pathovers).

### Formalization of graphs

- Papers relevant to formalizations of graphs

#### {% cite Tammet1996 %}

In this paper, the authors show as their main result, the formalization of the
Euler formula. To achieve this they define inductively planar graphs by using
cycles.


#### {% cite BauerN02 %}

This paper is about the formalization of the [Five-Colour
theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_color_theorem). In this, the authors
show an inductive definition for **near triangulations** in order to define
inductively planar graphs. This definition has three constructors:

  ![](/assets/png-images/2018-09-20-meetings-4fc8e00a.png)

Some results:
  - Any planar graph has at least a vertex of at least degree less or equals five.
  - Idem for near triangulations.
