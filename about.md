I'm a Ph.D. student in the first-year at [University of
Bergen](https://www.uib.no/en/ii) under the advisory of [Marc
Bezem](https://cas.oslo.no/fellows/marc-bezem-article2086-828.html) and
co-supervised by [Bjørn Ian
Dundas](https://cas.oslo.no/fellows/bjorn-ian-dundas-article2087-828.html).
We mostly work nowadays in type theory. It's fun.

Before came to Norway, I lived in Medellín, Colombia where I did my Master
in the Mathematical Sciences Department at [Universidad
EAFIT](http://www.eafit.edu.co/) under the
[advisory](http://www1.eafit.edu.co/asr/supervised-students.html) of [Andrés
Sicard-Ramírez](http://www1.eafit.edu.co/asr/) in the group of the [Logic and
Computation](http://scienti.colciencias.gov.co:8080/gruplac/jsp/visualiza/visualizagr.jsp?nro=00000000008091)
research group.

My current interests for research are mostly the connections between computer
science and mathematics such as verification, type theory, functional
programming, logic, proof-assistants, among others related.

### About this blog

The sources of this blog are open source. The blog is using the following projects:

- `github-pages`
- `jekyll` with the my modified version of the minima theme
- `algolia` provides the search engine plus modifications
- `agda` to type-check some experiments
- `agda2html` for embedding `Agda` code in Html
- `ipe` to draw all my pictures
- Since April 2018 I changed to [https://tex.s2cms.com/](https://tex.s2cms.com/) to render `Latex` instead of `KaTeX`
- `timelinejs` to show some test timelines
- `linkify` to replace any url address to anchor tags
