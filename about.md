I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at [University of Bergen](https://www.uib.no/en/ii) under the
advisory of [Marc
Bezem](https://cas.oslo.no/fellows/marc-bezem-article2086-828.html) and
co-supervised by [Bjørn Ian
Dundas](https://cas.oslo.no/fellows/bjorn-ian-dundas-article2087-828.html).

Before, I did my Master in Applied Mathematics in the Mathematical Sciences Department at [Universidad EAFIT](http://www.eafit.edu.co/).
I was under the [advisory](http://www1.eafit.edu.co/asr/supervised-students.html) of [Andrés Sicard-Ramírez](http://www1.eafit.edu.co/asr/) in the group of the [Logic and Computation](http://scienti.colciencias.gov.co:8080/gruplac/jsp/visualiza/visualizagr.jsp?nro=00000000008091) research group.

My current research interests are connections between mathematics and computer science:
verification, functional programming, type theory, logic, proof-assistants and lately categories.

### About this blog

The sources of this blog are open source. The blog is using the following projects:

- `github-pages`
- `jekyll` with minima theme
- `algolia` provides the search engine plus modifications
- `agda` to type-check some experiments
- `agda2html` for embedding `Agda` code in Html
- `ipe` to draw all my pictures
- Since April 2018 I changed to [https://tex.s2cms.com/](https://tex.s2cms.com/) to render `Latex` instead of `KaTeX`
- `timelinejs` to show some test timelines
- `linkify` to replace any url address to anchor tags
