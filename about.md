Hey you, I got something to tell you.
If you are reading this blog you may
notice than everything is unfinished.
That's not going to change, sorry.
I believe in continuous writing, that
is like maintain a repository working
as a programmer. Maybe because I am
always changing to improve the output.
Every now and again I change some texts,
adding better explanations, pictures or
references. So, If you find something
wrong don't hesitate, please feel free
to send me an email (prieto.jona@gmail.com),
I'll fix it and I'll say thanks you!


How I'm building this blog:

- github-pages
- jekyll with minima theme
- algolia plus some modifications provide the search engine
- agda to typecheck some experiments
- agda2html for embedding Agda code in post
- ipe to draw the pictures
- Timelinejs to show some test timelines
- more...
