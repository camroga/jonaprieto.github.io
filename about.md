Hey you, I got something to tell you.
If you are reading this blog you may
notice than everything is unfinished.
That's not going to change, [sorry](https://open.spotify.com/track/2h6ogDxsZ6Tzy82g16nhFa?si=DXwnhcO5QKG0VpesQmgnyw).
I believe in continuous writing
as same as a programmer maintaining a repository.
Every now and again I will change some texts,
adding better explanations, pictures or
references. So, If you find something
wrong don't hesitate, please feel free
to send me an email (`prieto.jona@gmail.com`).
Last thing, I'm not a english native speaker as
you probably already noticed but I'm doing my best
effort to improve that. Let me know please if you find some
typo or mistake, I'll appreciate it.

I'm using this technology to run this blog:

- `github-pages`
- `jekyll` with minima theme
- `algolia` provides the search engine plus modifications
- `agda` to type-check some experiments
- `agda2html` for embedding `Agda` code in Html
- `ipe` to draw the pictures
- `timelinejs` to show some test timelines
- Since April 2018 I changed to [https://tex.s2cms.com/](https://tex.s2cms.com/) to render `Latex` instead of `KaTeX`
