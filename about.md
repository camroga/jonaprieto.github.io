### This blog

Hey you, I got something to tell you. If you are reading this blog you may
notice than everything is unfinished. That's not going to change,
[sorry](https://open.spotify.com/track/2h6ogDxsZ6Tzy82g16nhFa?si=DXwnhcO5QKG0VpesQmgnyw).
I believe in continuous writing as same as a programmer maintaining a
repository. Every now and again I will change some texts, adding better
explanations, pictures or references. So, If you find something wrong or want to
share something don't hesitate to email me. Please use this email
(`prieto.jona@gmail.com`). Include with the message the hash of the commit after
`Latest commit` in [`Home`](https://jonaprieto.github.io/) in case you need to
refer some particular post.

Last thing, I'm not a english native speaker as you probably already noticed but
I'm doing my best effort to improve that. Let me know please if you find some
typo or mistake, I'll appreciate it.

#### Tools

I'm using these tools to run this blog:

- `github-pages`
- `jekyll` with minima theme
- `algolia` provides the search engine plus modifications
- `agda` to type-check some experiments
- `agda2html` for embedding `Agda` code in Html
- `ipe` to draw all my pictures
- Since April 2018 I changed to [https://tex.s2cms.com/](https://tex.s2cms.com/) to render `Latex` instead of `KaTeX`
- `timelinejs` to show some test timelines
