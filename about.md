### About me

A Ph.D. student at University of Bergen. I'm interested about the connections
between mathematics and computer science. Enjoy learning about types, functional
programming and logic. I code in python, mathematica, haskell and nowadays agda.
For more information, checkout this repository [cv](http://github.com/jonaprieto/curriculum-vitae).

### About this blog

The sources of this blog are open source. The blog is using the following projects:

- `github-pages`
- `jekyll` with minima theme
- `algolia` provides the search engine plus modifications
- `agda` to type-check some experiments
- `agda2html` for embedding `Agda` code in Html
- `ipe` to draw all my pictures
- Since April 2018 I changed to [https://tex.s2cms.com/](https://tex.s2cms.com/) to render `Latex` instead of `KaTeX`
- `timelinejs` to show some test timelines
- `linkify` to replace any url address to anchor tags
