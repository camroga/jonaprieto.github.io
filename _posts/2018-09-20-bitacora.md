This is my bitacora.
Some conventions used here
( 📆 : todo , 🚶 :‍ reading , ✍️ : writing , ❓ : question  and 🏁 : goal, and 🔧 :fixing).

### Research topics

The goals and topics can change along the time, nowadays
I'm working on the following.

**(homotopy) type theory**

- [pathovers](http://tinyurl.com/pathorvers): proofs finished, fixing the writing ✍️
- [circle equivalences](http://tinyurl.com/pathorvers): removing a postulate  ✍️
- [mini-hott](http://tinyurl.com/mini-hott): a mini hott library for Agda ✍️
- A HIT can be seen as graph where each point-constructor is a node,
  each path-constructor is an edge. By changing the direction of one edge, can we get another HIT equivalent❓

**Formal graph theory**

- 🚶 What is a *good* characterization for planar graphs. What really does
  *good* means? good from the verification point of view or to be most suitable
  to use (depend, hott) type theory❓  
  
  When $$ A : Type$$ when want to have a property like `isPlanar` such that it
  is not a proposition in the HoTT context.

{:.equation }
  $$ \sum_{g:\mathsf{Graph}(A)}~\mathsf{isPlanar_{A}(g)}.$$

### Meetings

Showing the most recent to the oldest.

#### **2018-09-14**

With Håkon:

- HoTT stuff: we review the lemmas for the flattening lemma. We went
through Lemma 6.12.1 to Lemma 6.12.7.
- Graphs: I commented a little bit the MacLane's cycle-space and
Tutte's theorem which relies on the idea of contractible version of the graphs
to use later the Kuratowski theorem.

With Marc:
- Working on [the circle article](http://tinyurl.com/circle-hott) to remove the postulated lemmas


#### **2018-09-07**

With Håkon:
- We sketch briefly **alga** or *the algebra of graphs* described in (\cite{Mokhov2017}).
- We review the inductive definition for graphs in {% cite Tammet1996 %},
we wanted to have a predicate like $$ \sum_{g:\mathsf{Graph}}~\mathsf{isPlanar(g)}$$
- Håkon also pointed out MacLane's planar graph characterization to
review in future sessions.

With Marc:
- Making some improvements to [Pathovers' article](http://tinyurl.com/pathovers).

### Formalization of graphs

- Papers relevant to formalizations of graphs:

**Inductive definitions**. Using inductive definitions allows us to
have for free an inductive principle to prove properties.
One issue using these kind of definitions is the difficulty that represents to
reason about their constructions. Which it's taking care of the order of the step
in the construction. So, how can we have a relation between these constructions
in such a away, a graph can be obtained by (homotopic?) constructions?.

#### {% cite yamamoto %}

In this paper, the authors show as their main result, the formalization of the
Euler formula. To achieve this they define inductively planar graphs by using the notion
of cycles. The formalization was done in `HOL`.


#### {% cite BauerN02 %}

This paper is about the formalization of the [Five-Colour
theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_color_theorem). In this, the authors
show an inductive definition for **near triangulations** in order to define
inductively planar graphs. This definition has three constructors:

  ![](/assets/png-images/2018-09-20-meetings-4fc8e00a.png)

Some results:
  - Any planar graph has at least a vertex of at least degree less or equals five.
  - Idem for near triangulations.

#### {% cite Bauer %}
Continuing with near triangulations, Bauer in this thesis has an extra
constructor for it.

He ends up Chapter 2 with the following summary of formalizations of
planar graphs.

  > Triangles vs. Polygons: The definition using triangles is by far eas- ier.
  > This simplifies proofs about the construction. If faces of arbi- trary
  > length can be added, the graph modifications and proofs about those are more
  > complex. On the other hand, a formalization based on triangles requires
  > operations to delete edges in order to construct non-triangular graphs,
  > which complicates a verification. Directed
