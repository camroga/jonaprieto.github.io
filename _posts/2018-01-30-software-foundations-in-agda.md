Just to mention that this year I found a new tutorial using Agda to show
concepts of logic and PLT.

The official repository and website is the following:

  https://wenkokke.github.io/sf/

However, I have my own fork where I put somethings that are missed in the
original or just fixing some typos.

  https://jonaprieto.github.io/sf

Anyway, thanks to the authors (Wen Kokke and Philip Wadler) for this new
resource to continue learning more about this interesting field.
