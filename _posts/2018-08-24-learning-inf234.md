- Big-Oh rules
- Omega, and small big-oh.
- Divide and Conquer
  - Sorting problem. Runtime analysis.
  - T(n) = a T(n/b) + O(n^a) where a is the branching factor, b is the size of the problems.
  - Geometric series: 1 + r + r^2 + ... + r^t = (1 - r^(t+1))/(1 - r)
    - if r < 1, the sums tends to be 1 / (1 - r).
  - MergeSort algorithm

- Master Theorem (and proof) (some logarithms rules viewed)

## 2018-09-03

- Review the formulation of the master algorithm
- Divide & conquer algorithm to find the median of an array of integers.
- Selection pivot algorithm to improve the median selection algorithm.

- [x] Exercise 2.5. Master Theorem
- [x] Exercise 2.12. Recurrence substitution.
- [x] Exercise 2.14. Just use Mergesort and remove naively the duplicates
- [x] Exercise 2.13. Catalan Numbers (Nice one).
      If $$B_{n+2}$$ is the number of full binary trees with exactly n vertices,
      then, we can compute recursively the solution by following that's equal to
      {: .eq }
        $$B_{n+2} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} B_{k} B_{n+1-k} $$

      where, $$B_{k} = 0$$ when k is odd and $$B_1 = 1$$.
