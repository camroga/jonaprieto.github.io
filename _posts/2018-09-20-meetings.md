### Meetings

- **2018-09-07**
  With Håkon:
  - We sketch briefly **alga** or *the algebra of graphs* described in (\cite{Mokhov2017}).
  - We review the inductive definition for graphs in {% cite Tammet1996 %},
  we wanted to have a predicate like $$ \sum_{g:\mathsf{Graph}}~\mathsf{isPlanar(g)}$$
  - Håkon also pointed out MacLane's planar graph characterization to
  review in future sessions.

- **2018-09-14**
  With Håkon:
  - HoTT stuff: we review the lemmas for the flattening lemma. We went
  through Lemma 6.12.1 to Lemma 6.12.7.
  - Graphs: no too much

### Literature

- Papers relevant to formalizations of planar graphs

#### {% cite Tammet1996 %}

In this paper, the authors show as their main result, the formalization of the
Euler formula. To achieve this they define inductively planar graphs by using
cycles.


#### {% cite BauerN02 %}

This paper is about the formalization of the [Five-Colour
theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_color_theorem). In this, the authors
show an inductive definition for **near triangulations** in order to define
inductively planar graphs. This definition has three constructors:

Some results:
  - Any planar graph has at least a vertex of at least degree less or equals five.
  - Idem for near triangulations.
