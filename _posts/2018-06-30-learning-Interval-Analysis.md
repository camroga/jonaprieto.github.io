## Interval and Related Software

- [ ] [Euler](http://www.euler-math-toolbox.de/Programs/08%20-%20Intervals.html)

  - Interval Arithmetic
  - [Interval Solvers and Guaranteed Solutions](http://www.euler-math-toolbox.de/reference/numerical.html#Interval_Solvers_and_Guaranteed_Solutions)


- [ALIAS Library](http://www-sop.inria.fr/coprin/index_english.html)

Algorithms Library of Interval Analysis for Systems; see also this link

- [ ] [AWA](ftp://ftp.iam.uni-karlsruhe.de/pub/awa/)

A software package for verified solution of ordinary differential equations.

- [ ] [CAPD, Computer-Assisted Proofs in Dynamics](http://capd.ii.uj.edu.pl/)

A C++ package for rigorous numerics for dynamical systems, oriented mostly for computer assisted proofs in dynamics.
This library provides provides rigorous solvers for ODEs, variational equations for ODEs, differential inclusions, automatic computation of Poincare maps and their derivatives, computation of homology of spaces, maps and many other features.

- [ ] [COSY](http://cosy.pa.msu.edu/)

This software package is based on Taylor model and interval methods. It is intended for verified solution of such problems as ordinary differential equations, quadrature, range bounding, etc. It can either be used as a stand-alone program or via C++ and Fortran 90/95 frontends.

- [ ] [VALENCIA-IVP](http://valencia-ivp.com/)

Software for VALidation of state ENClosures using Interval Arithmetic for Initial Value Problems

- [ ] [VNODE-LP](http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~nedialk/vnodelp/)
A C++ based Interval Solver for Initial Value Problems in Ordinary Differential Equations

- [ ] [Pytaylor](http://gitorious.org/pytaylor)

A Python package implementing Taylor models and associated guaranteed ODE solvers.
Pytaylor uses mpmath for interval arithmetic and sympy for symbolic manipulation.


- [ ] [INTLAB - INTerval LABoratory](http://www.ti3.tu-harburg.de/rump/intlab/index.html)

An interval toolbox for Matlab; free for non-commercial use.
